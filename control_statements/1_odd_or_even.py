# When user provide the program needs to say is an odd or a even
# Input
# N -> INT
# Output
# Text -> ( Odd or Even )

# Logic:
# When a number divisible by 2 is called a even 
# When a number not divisible by 2 is called as odd
# Quotient  ( // ) -> Not Useful
# Remainder  ( % ) -> Its is useful becoz whenever the remainder is 0 called even else odd

# a = int(input("Enter a number :"))

# if a % 2 == 0:
#     print("Even")
# else:
#     print("Odd")


# a = float(input("Enter a number :"))
# print(type(a))

# tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,6)
# tuple1 = list(tuple1) 
# tuple1[4] = 15
# tuple1 = tuple(tuple1)
# print(tuple1, type(tuple1))
